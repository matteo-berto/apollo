# apollo
Python library for post-processing the flux-linkages maps of synchronous machines.

The flux-linkages maps of a synchronous machine can be imported and post-processed in apollo to compute the inductances, the MTPA trajectory, and self-sensing capabilities of the motor [1],[2].

apollo is part of dolomites-python and can be downloaded here:\
